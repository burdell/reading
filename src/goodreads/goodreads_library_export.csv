Which I don’t think is true<br/><br/>Overall recommend if you’re looking for an interesting history on the BeltLine and its future ",,,1,0

The government in We is way less sinister than 1984 and you could really even argue that it's ultimate goal was the flourishing of the people under its rule. It's easy to denounce the overreach and crimes of Big Brother, but in a culture driven by rapidly advancing knowledge and sheer amounts of data, are we as willing to admit to ourselves that those will ultimately fail as our saviors as well?<br/><br/>Also, while it made parts of this book tough to follow, the jagged, frantic writing in parts really works well.",,,2,0

His fictions tell us, with intensifying urgency, that this culture is more at risk than we might have thought, that the restless concerns of secular and instrumentalist thinking are fast eroding it, so that we may wake up and discover we no longer know how to respond with either respect or compassion to each other, and so have literally nothing to say""<br/><br/>This is a dense book and a parts of it went way over my head, but really does a fantastic job of getting to the core of why Dostoevsky's ideas will always be relevant.

Most times she ends up in the general vicinity of where you think she'd go, but often takes a different path to get there, or ends up slightly left or right where you think she'd land.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

I suspect it will last for about a month...</i><br/><br/>This is one of the books that seemingly everybody put on their best-of-2015 list, so I picked it up. I'm not planning on ever writing a memoir, and I'm not super drawn to the genre in particular, though I think I'll maybe read more memoirs after reading this book.<br/><br/>There were parts that were too how-to that I just wasn't interested in. I also felt many of Karr's references to other memoir authors assumed too much familiarity from the reader. (The chapter on the one author I HAD read, Vladimir Nabokov, was unbelievably spot-on though).<br/><br/>Apart from those 2 things, this book was great. Karr really understands the way humanity derives both meaning and connection from personal narrative, both through telling one's own and hearing other people tell theirs. She also addresses the difficulty and almost universal phenomena of misremembering and reinterpreting, feeling shame from the uglier parts, and the feeling of inadequacy when comparing yourself to others; all things that anybody, memoirist or not, can relate to.<br/><br/>",,,1,0
